# Thesis Main Algorithms

This is a respository to share the main algorithms which I developed during my PhD.
The algorithms was mainly used in the post-process of very big Delft3D output files.
The data was stored in a hdf5 file aligned for spatial and temporal analysis.
The algorith to calculate the Estuary Number is also included.

The thesis was submitted in the [Postgraduate Program in Water Resources and Environmental Engineering](http://www.prppg.ufpr.br/ppgerha/en/) at [Federal University of Parana](http://www.ufpr.br/) and it was entitled "Linking water quality issues with residence time and dimensionless numbers in reservoirs".
