# Thesis Main Algorithms

This is a respository to share the main algorithms which I developed during my PhD.
The algorithms was mainly used in the post-process of very big Delft3D output files.
As matrix does not fit in RAM memory, the data was stored in hdf5 file aligned for spatial and temporal analysis.
The main metric (Estuary Number) assessed and indentified in the thesis is also included.

The thesis was submitted in the [Postgraduate Program in Water Resources and Environmental Engineering](http://www.prppg.ufpr.br/ppgerha/en/) at [Federal University of Parana](http://www.ufpr.br/) and it was entitled "Linking water quality issues with residence time and dimensionless numbers in reservoirs".
